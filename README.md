# Speech to Indian Sign Language using 3D Avatar Animation  

This project aims to **convert spoken language into Indian Sign Language (ISL) using a 3D avatar**. It is designed to help bridge communication gaps for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by displaying ISL gestures in a structured and natural way.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Converts **speech to text** using NLP techniques  
- Transforms text into **ISL grammar structure**  
- Displays **3D avatar animations** for ISL gestures  
- Supports **dynamic word-to-sign mapping**  
- Handles **unknown words** by spelling them using ISL alphabet signs  

## 🏗️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** – For speech processing and NLP  
- **Blender** – For 3D avatar animation  
- **spaCy/NLTK** – For ISL grammar extraction  
- **HTML,CSS,Javascript,Flask** – For GUI interface
